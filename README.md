# Lesson Tracker

## About
Lesson Tracker is a web application designed to help teachers efficiently manage and track their lessons and students. It enables teachers to organize students by different criteria and maintain a record of their lessons. This repository contains both the backend and frontend components of the application.

## Backend
The backend of Lesson Tracker is built as a RESTful API using Express.js, Sequelize, and SQLite3. It includes three primary models: Teachers, Students, and Lessons. The API supports various operations, including full CRUD functionalities for some resources and specific queries for others. Authentication and authorization are implemented securely using JWT tokens.

## Frontend
To Be Determined (TBD)
The frontend will be developed using React and Redux, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for interacting with the lesson tracking system.
